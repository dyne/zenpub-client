## Getting started

The client connects to a graphql endpoint to perform queries and mutation over the database. 
In order to launch locally the client, you’ll need a running backend. [Here](https://github.com/reflow-project/zenpub-client/blob/develop/HACKING.md) you will find a detailed documentation about how to run the backend locally (manually or with docker).
Once you’ve a backend up and running on http://localhost:4000/api/graphql, you can move further running the client.
*(nd. If you just want to run `storybook`, there is no need to install and run any backend, as stories are populated with fake data)*
#
##### Get the code
`git clone https://github.com/reflow-project/zenpub-client.git`

##### Install the needed dependencies
```
yarn
```

##### Extract the languages
We use [linguijs](https://lingui.js.org/index.html) to provide multi-languages. Before launching the app, make sure you’ve added one or more translations to the app.

Currently it is translated in the following languages: 

	en_GB: 'English, British',
    en_US: 'English, USA',
    es_MX: 'Español, Méjico',
    es_ES: 'Español, España',
    fr_FR: 'Français, France',
    eu: 'Euskara',
    ar_SA: 'العربية, المملكة العربية السعودية'
    

Apart from en_GB that is the default language, feel free do add the needed translations for your scope, when launching the script:
 
```
yarn add locale en_GB en_US es_MX es_ES fr_FR eu ar_SA
```


##### Launch 
`yarn start`

Visit http://localhost:3000 🌱

##### or launch Storybook
